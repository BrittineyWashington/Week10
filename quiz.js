//Displaying the Quiz Questions
//object literals to represent the indiidual questions
//array to hold all of the questions that make up the quiz. 
    //-using an array will make the questions easier to iterate over

//switch up my questions to trivia: Office, Friends, AEW
//these are listed in order of how they are added, if want them presented in a sorted way will have to sort the array of objects in JS.
