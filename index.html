<!--Reminder:
For this project and all remaining projects, you should have a file called .gitignore in your project directory. In that file you should have a line that says "/node_modules" without the quotes. This tells git to ignore all your node module dependencies when it pushes code to your repo.
You should also have a file called package.json in your project directory. Please make sure this file gets pushed to your Github repo with all your other project files. This file is a manifest or list of all dependencies that your project requires to function properly. With this file someone can clone your repo and then run "npm install" in the project directory and they will automatically download all the node module dependencies needed.

Coding Steps:

A Bootstrap styled table representing your choice of data.
